## Mapping Salt Lake City

Mapping Salt Lake City is a community-created archive of Salt Lake City’s neighborhoods and people that documents the city’s changes through art, critical and creative literature, personal maps and multi-media projects.

We invite people to engage with and evolve this site by submitting their own contributions.


## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all these prerequisites on your development machine.
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/download/) and the npm package manager, if you encounter any problems, you can also use this [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.
* MongoDB - [Download & Install MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads), and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).
* Bower - You're going to use the [Bower Package Manager](http://bower.io/) to manage your front-end packages, in order to install it make sure you've installed Node.js and npm, then install bower globally using npm:

```
$ npm install -g bower
```

* Grunt - You're going to use the [Grunt Task Runner](http://gruntjs.com/) to automate your development process, in order to install it make sure you've installed Node.js and npm, then install grunt globally using npm:

```
$ sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```

### Cloning The Mapping SLC GitHub Repository
You can also use Git to directly clone the Mapping Salt Lake City repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/PoetsRock/MappingSLC.git
```
This will clone the latest version of the Mapping Salt Lake City repository to your local machine.

## Quick Install
Begin by installing the Node.js dependencies.  Go to your application folder and run in the command line:

```
$ npm install
```

We've noticed that, on occasion, you need to run this command two or three times to get all of the dependencies.
Additionally, you'll want to run:

```
$ bower install
```

(If it asks you to pick a version of AngularJS, select version 1.2.26.)

## Running Your Application
After the install process is over, you'll be able to run your application using Grunt, just run grunt default task:

```
$ grunt
```

Your application should run on the 3000 port so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
                            
That's it! your application should be running by now, to proceed with your development check the other sections in this documentation. 
If you encounter any problem try the Troubleshooting section.
