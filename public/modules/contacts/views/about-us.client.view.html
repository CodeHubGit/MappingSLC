                            <p>Mapping Salt Lake City is a not-for-profit community project based on <a
                                    href="http://rebeccasolnit.tumblr.com/infinitecity" target="_blank">Rebecca Solnit's
                                book <em>Infinite City</em></a>, which maps many of the communities and histories that
                                make up San Francisco. Initially the focus of a 2013 nonfiction writing course at the
                                University of Utah taught by Paisley Rekdal, Mapping Salt Lake City has quickly become a
                                city-wide collaboration led by professors, writers and scholars from the University of
                                Utah and Westminster College.</p>

                            <p>Because a city and its history are not static but a complex network of connections,
                                environment and relationships, the purpose of Mapping Salt Lake City is to create a
                                continually evolving narrative in which community members and scholars, writers and
                                artists can be in dialogue. And because there are always absences in any record of
                                place, we rely on readers to fill in these gaps by writing and submitting their own
                                content. Over the years, as more people add their own stories, Mapping Salt Lake City
                                will change, expand and grow in the same ways that a city might, to become a more
                                inclusive reflection of our community's diverse, and diverging, perspectives.</p>

                            <p>Interested participants can <a
                                    href="index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;layout=item&amp;id=4&amp;Itemid=279">contribute</a>
                                in a number of ways: by writing a critical, historical or personal essay or by producing
                                a multi-media project about a subject relevant to Salt Lake; by creating a personal city
                                map using mapping technologies such as Google Maps or Google Earth; by drawing their own
                                Salt Lake City <a
                                        href="index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;layout=item&amp;id=5&amp;Itemid=280">using
                                    the map found on our site</a>; or by writing for our ongoing project, "This Was
                                Here."</p>

                            <p>We welcome you to join our community, either by assisting in the development of the site,
                                or by submitting work to the project.</p>


                            <p>Mapping Salt Lake City also occasionally provides teaching resources and exercises
                                involving creative mapping projects for educators in the Salt Lake City region. For
                                current examples, see our <a
                                        href="index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;layout=item&amp;id=5&amp;Itemid=280">Resources</a>
                                page. We are also interested in meeting with small groups and classes to lead creative
                                mapping workshops. For more info, <a
                                        href="index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;layout=item&amp;id=6&amp;Itemid=281">please

                            <p>Our hope is for Mapping Salt Lake City to become an integral site for the community to
                                visit, a place for people to enter the complex conversation about place that has already
                                begun, and that continues to evolve, around Salt Lake City.</p>
